This can often be useful to simulate a \"naive\" existing prediction process in a product or system. For example, a product might have been originally hardcoded to assume that all new users will spend $100 in the first month, regardless of their features. If we encode that assumption into a baseline model, we are able to concretely state the benefits of using a machine learning approach.\n",

By default, scikit-learn predicts an observation is part of the positive class if the probabaility is greater than 0.5 (called the *threshold*). However, instead of a middle ground, we will often want to explicitly bias our model to use a different threshold for substantive reasons. For example, if a false positive is very costly to our company, we might prefer a model that has a high probability threshold. We fail to predict some positives, but when an observation is predicted to be postivie, we can be very confident that the prediction is correct. This trade-off isrepresnted in the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR).\n",

Accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the number of observations and works just as well in the multiclass as binary setting. However, when we have imbalanced classes (a common scenario), we should be inclined to use other evaluation metrics.\n",

Precision, recall, and F1 scores are useful metrics that we have already covered in detial in previous recipes. While all of them were originally designed for binary classifiers, we can apply them to multiclass settings by treating our data as a set of binary classes. Doing so enables us to apply the metrics to each class as if it were the only class in the data, and then aggregate the evaluation scores for all the classes by averaging them:"

It does this by taking the distances from the points to the regression line (these distances are the “errors”) and squaring them. The squaring is necessary to remove any negative signs.

    "MSE is one of the most common evaluation metrics for regression models. Formally, MSE is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n} * \\sum_{i=0}^n{(\\hat y_i - y_i)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of observations\n",
    "$y_i$ is the true value of the target we are trying to predict for observation $i$\n",
    "$\\hat y_i$ is the model's predicted value\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is a measurement of the squared sum of all distances between predicted and true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the value of MSE, the greater the total squared error and thus the worse the model. Ther are a number of mathematical benefits to squaring the error term, including that it forced all error alues to be positive, but one often unrealized implication is that squaring penalizes a few large errors mroe than many small errors, even if the absolute value of the errors is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine wo models, A and B, each with two observations:\n",
    "* Model A has errors of 0 and 10 and thus its MSE is $0^2 + 10^2 = 100$.\n",
    "* Model B has two errors of 5 each, and thus its MSE is $5^2 + 5^2 = 50$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models have the same total error, 10; however, MSE would consider Model A (MSE = 100) worse than Model B (MSE=50). In practice this implicatino is rarely an issue (and indeed can be theoretically beneficial) and MSE works perfectly fine as an evaluation metric\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note: by default in scikit-learn arguments of the `scoring` parameter assume that higher values are better than lower values. However, this is not the case for MSE, where higher values mean a worse model. For this reason, scikit-learn looks at the negative MSE using the `neg_mean_squared_error` argument\n",
    "\n",
    "A common alternative regression evaluation metric is $R^2$, which measures the amount of variance in the target vector that is explained by the model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \\hat y_i)^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \\bar y)^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\hat y_i$ is the predicted value for the ith observation\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\bar y$ is the mean value of the target vector. \n",

    "Learning curves visualize the performance (e.g. accuracy, recall) of a model on the training set and during cross-validation as the number of observatino in the training set increases. They are commonly used to detemrine if our learning algorithms would benefit from gathering addition training data.\n",

    "In our solution, we plot the accuracy of a random forest classifier at 50 different training set sizes ranging from 1% of observation to 100%. THe increasing accuracy score of the cross-validated models tell us that we would likely benefit from additional observations (although in practice this might not be feasible).\n",

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "Most training algorithms contain hyperparameters that must be chosen before the training process begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a random forest classifier creates a \"forest\" of decision trees, each of  which vote so n the predicted classo f an observaiton. One hyperparameter in random forest classifiers is the number of tress in the forest. Most often hyperparameter values are selcted during model selection. However, it is occasionally useful to visualize how model performance changes as the hyperparameters changes. In our solution, we plot the changes in accuracy for a random forest classifier for the training set and during cross-validation as the number of trees increases. When we have a small number of trees, both the training and cross-validation score are low, suggesting the model is underfitted. As the number of trees increases to 250, the accuracy of both levels off, suggesting there is probably not much value in the computation cost of traingin a massive forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sci-kit-learn, we can calculate the validation curve using `validation_curve`, which contains three important parameters:\n",
    "* `param_name` is the name of the hyperparameter to vary\n",
    "* `param_range` is the value of the hyperparmeter to use\n",
    "* `scoring` is the evaluation metric used to judge the model.\n",
